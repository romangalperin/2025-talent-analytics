# Introduction

In this exercise, we will build a predictive model using logistic
regression to analyze examiner behavior based on patent application
data. Our goal is to predict one of two possible binary outcomes:

1.  **Examiner Exit:** Whether an examiner exits (leaves the job) based
    on application data.
2.  **Examiner Mobility:** Whether an examiner moves across different
    art units (AUs).

We will follow a structured workflow, ensuring that our analysis is
systematic and reproducible.

# Step 1: Load the Data

Before we begin modeling, we need to load the dataset containing
examiner-level application data. Ensure that the dataset includes
relevant features, such as:

- Examiner ID
- Application processing history
- Examiner’s demographic details (e.g., gender, race)
- Examiner’s tenure (computed from earliest known date)
- Disposal outcomes (e.g., ISS, ABN, PEND)
- Examiner’s art unit (AU) details

Once the data is loaded, examine its structure and identify missing
values or inconsistencies.

``` r
# your code here
```

# Step 2: Define the Prediction Target

To perform a binary classification, we must clearly define our dependent
variable.

## **Predicting Examiner Exit**

- We define an examiner as “exited” if they are not associated with any
  applications after a given period.
- The dependent variable will be coded as:
  - `1` if the examiner exits
  - `0` if the examiner remains active

``` r
# your code here
```

## **And/Or Predicting Examiner Mobility**

- An examiner is classified as “mobile” if they change art units during
  their tenure.
- The dependent variable will be coded as:
  - `1` if the examiner moves to a different AU
  - `0` if the examiner stays in the same AU

``` r
# your code here
```

# Step 3: Data Preprocessing

To prepare the data for modeling, follow some of the steps below that
you think are necessary:

1.  **Extract the relevant features** from the dataset.
2.  **Convert categorical variables** (e.g., gender, race) into numeric
    factors.
3.  **Create time-based features**, such as examiner tenure in months.
4.  **Handle missing values** by either imputing or removing them.
5.  **Standardize numerical variables** if necessary, though logistic
    regression is robust to scale differences.

``` r
# your code here
```

# Step 4: Split the Data

To assess model performance, divide the dataset into:

- **Training set (70%)** – Used to fit the logistic regression model.
- **Testing set (30%)** – Used to evaluate model accuracy.

Ensure that the data is shuffled before splitting to avoid bias in
training.

``` r
# your code here
```

# Step 5: Train a Logistic Regression Model

Logistic regression is a statistical method used to predict binary
outcomes. The general form of the model is:

$$ \log \left( \frac{p}{1 - p} \right) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + \beta_2 X_2 + ... + \beta_n X_n $$

where: - $p$ is the probability of the outcome occurring. -
$X_1, X_2, ...$ are predictor variables (e.g., tenure, number of
applications processed).

Fit a logistic regression model using the training data, specifying the
appropriate dependent and independent variables.

``` r
# your code here
```

# Step 6: Evaluate the Model

To assess model quality, use the following metrics:

1.  **Accuracy** – The proportion of correctly classified instances.
2.  **Confusion Matrix** – A table showing true positives, false
    positives, true negatives, and false negatives.
3.  **ROC Curve & AUC** – Measures how well the model distinguishes
    between classes.

To generate the ROC curve: - Compute predicted probabilities on the test
dataset. - Use a range of probability thresholds to classify outcomes. -
Plot sensitivity vs. 1-specificity to visualize the model’s
discriminatory power. - Compute the **Area Under the Curve (AUC)** to
quantify performance.

``` r
# Placeholder for ROC plot code
```

# Step 7: Interpret the Model

After fitting and evaluating the model, interpret the key findings:

- **Which variables are significant predictors?**
- **What is the direction of the effect?** (e.g., Does longer tenure
  reduce exit probability?)
- **How well does the model generalize to new data?**

Discuss limitations, including potential biases, omitted variables, and
data quality issues.

# Step 8: Apply Your Model

Using the trained model, generate insights and recommendations.
Consider:

- **Policy Implications:** What interventions could reduce examiner exit
  rates?
- **Operational Insights:** How might workload or tenure influence
  retention?
- **Further Improvements:** What additional data could enhance
  predictions?

# Deliverables

Each student should submit:

1.  A brief description of their predictive model.
2.  An evaluation of model performance (including AUC and ROC curve).
3.  An interpretation of results, highlighting key factors affecting
    examiner exit or mobility.
4.  Practical recommendations based on the analysis.

This exercise is designed to provide a hands-on introduction to
predictive modeling while reinforcing key concepts in logistic
regression and model evaluation.
